SHORT: The Insulin Calculator provides a straightforward and quick way calculate insulin doses for people with diabetes.


The Insulin Calculator provides a straightforward and easy way to calculate insulin doses for people with diabetes.
It is intended for educational purposes to help with standard insulin dose calculations.


NOTE: The results provided by the Insulin Calculator are for educational purposes ONLY. All results should be
externally calculated and confirmed before any insulin is administered.


Here are some of the ways you can use the skill -

Alexa, ask Insulin Calculator What's my blood glucose correction dose?
Alexa, ask Insulin Calculator What's my blood glucose correction dose if my current level is two hundred?

Alexa, ask Insulin Calculator How much insulin do I need if I am eating carbs
Alexa, ask Insulin Calculator How many units of insulin do I need if I eat sixty grams of carbs?

Alexa, ask Insulin Calculator to calculate dose with current blood glucose two hundred and eating sixty grams of carbs.

You can also reset stored data using the following command:
Alexa, tell Insulin Calculator to reset my stored values.


TEST Notes:
Hi Test team.
This skill essentially provides three simple calculations.
1. ICD = (CBGL - TBGL) / CF
2. CID = CTBE / CR
3. TDFM = ICD + CID

CBGL = Current Blood Glucose Level
TBGL = Target Blood Glucose Level
CF   = Correction Factor
ICD  = Insulin correction dose

CTBE = Carbs to be eaten
CR   = Carb Ratio
CID  = Carb insulin dose

TDFM = Total dose for mealtime

However the variables for these calculations can change for each
mealtime (breakfast, lunch & dinner). The skill asks for variables
if it has not collected them already but will reuse them if it has collected
them from a previous calculation request during that specific mealtime.

The DymamoDB will collect the below data points:
      "target_bg_level_day",
      "target_bg_level_night",
      "correction_factor_day",
      "correction_factor_night",
      "carb_ratio_breakfast",
      "carb_ratio_lunch",
      "carb_ratio_dinner",
      "time_adj",
      "time_zone"
